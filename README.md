## Hotel Booking Analysis Project  

### Overview  
This project explores a dataset related to hotel bookings, aiming to uncover trends, relationships, and actionable insights. Using Python and Jupyter Notebook, the analysis involves structured steps such as data understanding, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and insight generation.  

### Objectives  
- Understand the dataset structure and identify key variables.  
- Perform one-dimensional (1D), two-dimensional (2D), and three-dimensional (3D) exploratory data analysis.  
- Handle missing data, detect duplicates, and derive meaningful insights through visualizations and statistical measures.  

### Key Features of the Analysis  
1. **Data Understanding**:  
   - Assess dataset dimensions and provide descriptive statistics for each column.  
   - Examine missing values and duplicates, and apply strategies to address them.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Visualize distributions and relationships among numerical and categorical variables.  
   - Use scatter plots, bar charts, and correlation matrices for detailed insights.  

3. **Insights and Conclusions**:  
   - Summarize findings and propose potential improvements for hotel operations.  

### Tools and Techniques  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and others for data manipulation and visualization.  
- **Notebook File**: `Hotel_Booking.ipynb` contains all scripts and visualizations for the analysis.
